# Food Truck Recommender System

This project is a food truck recommender system built using Python and Django + React. The recommender system suggests food trucks to users based on their preferences and current location. It utilizes machine learning techniques such as cosine similarity and nearest neighbors to make personalized recommendations.

## Overview

The recommender system combines user preferences, such as preferred food items, with the geographical proximity of food trucks to the user's location. It ranks food trucks based on their similarity to the user's preferences and their proximity to the user.
